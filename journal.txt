27/5/2025 - set up the repo for the hunt the wumpus project.
Spent some time learning about the original 1973 game.
Created the cave class document and wrote the first attributes (name and decription).
30/5/2025 - Write the main.py program to call the class and make the first cave object.
Modified the attributes to set up name on initialisation
Wrote setter and getter methods for each attributes. Started planning the layout of the caves.
2/6/2025 - Wrote a dictionary attribute to store the links to other cave
Wrote and tested a method to print the linked_caves dictionary to the terminal.
3/6/2025 - Added code to the main program to allow the player to move between different cave objects.
Set up a new Character class and test program.
Created 'joyboy - The smelly Wumpus' in the test program and tested the conversation method.
 4/6/2025 - Set up enemy sub-class from character class. 
 Also added enemey weakness by introducing "combat_item" to "Joyboy" the enemy with "touching grass".
Wrote a method for fight() that overrides the fight() method in the super-class
Updated the char_text code to test the new sub-class objects (particularly the weakness and fight_methods)
6/6/2025 - Finishes testing the character in the char.test.py file. Added Joyboy obbject to the main program 
and added it to the dunngeon object. Reworked the main loop to accept different inputs (moving, talking and fighting)
- still need to finish the code to manage fighting.
10/6/2025 - Completed the tutorial for Hunt The Wumpus. Started to make more ideas to continue on with the project.
13/6/2025 - Came up with Idea to make the Game Terraria for the map of the game. The first idea of an Among us shaped map did
not go well. not one bit...
16/6/2025 - Continued working on my Terraria map, argueing with myself whether the level system or an open world with no restrictions. You level up when you travel through each level
- Order of each level is forest, jungle, hallowed, and corruption.
- started to change "cave" and "caverns" to "area" and "areas" to fit my terraria scenery. Messed up hard, I think. 
17/6/2025 - Fixed the problem of changing cave/cavern to area/areas by deleting 'name', changing from 'def __init__name():' to 'def __init__():
- Don't know how/why name was There 
- Continued planning the map and scenery; adding more areas to each biome, adding a Wise Hermit, asks you to choose 2 golden chests from "West" and "South".
- West chest tranforms into golden chest mimic when chosen
- South chest grants you to upgrade your iron sword to golden
- Colour coded the areas according to their biome (except spawn: brown) 
18/6/2025 - continued expanding my map in excel
- Started putting the areas into my codespace 
20/6/2025 - changed hallow biome to sky islands because i thought it would be cooler and make more sense having the north direction from the wooden house because it goes upwards
- The idea for the sky island is that it requires completing level 2 in the jungle biome, adding 2 new areas called "A frayed knot" to climb up to the "Jungle shrine"
- The jungle shrine will have a chest that contains a "Cloud in a bottle" and a sword upgrade called the "Blade of grass" making the sword shoot leaves as projectiles (melee/range weapon)
1/07/2025 - continued my code with linked areas, inlcuding adding a new area called skystone house.
2/07/2025 - added 2 new classes to put in character.py: treasure chest and inventory. Im not finished coding the inventory class fully yet, pls continue and dont forget. i begs of u.
- I had help with copilot AI to explain and write me a code for these two classes
24/7/25 - I continued to work on my map on excel, expanding on the skyisland with the inspired by another game with their characters, including HOG RIIDAAAAHHHHHH.
-They were all enemy classes.
25/7/25 - I continued on the excl map to think of ideas what each creatue would do when you fight and what would you fight with.
- decided to make a dragon inspired by terraria called "Betsy".
- This is the first boss you fight against. It will have 3 hitponits (hit it with your weapons 3 times).
- Decided to make a Prime Yogan (All Seeing) to be the final boss in the crimson biome.
28/7/25 - I put all areas and link areas, moving onto coding what they will say and do (interactions action).
29/7/25 - Did WAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY too much coding and planning in my head and in this codespace. started in school working on how to make an Guide NPC, with the help of copilot.
- Gave copilot question on why it had to be imported from character.py file into the main, realised how obvious it was.
- Ran out of time in school to make the first enemy subclass'angy gnome' spawning in the platforms to be your first encounter. Haven't coded him in yet.
- Also i figured out how to fix github preventing me from push commits. It was doing this because I had "fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches." error showing in the terminal.
- To fix this, I had to to type git pull --no-rebase.
30/7/25 - Continued on fixing bugs and having a bit of friendly UI features, like changing North, East, So and West to N, E, S, W.
- Changed the repo name and added another maintest.py file. 
- Also added a new feature for the angy gnome enemy not letting you pass, unless you defeat it.
- Added an add_item and remove.item def for treasure chest to have items in them.
- Having trouble with making it appear in the abandoned room, probably gonna ask for help in school.
31/7/25 - had to use copilot this time, not chatgpt. I think I confused it a little, because there were wayyyyyyy too many mistakes I had clarify with that AI platform.
- The parts that I had to fix were making sure the angy_gnome was still appearing. to fix this, I had forgot to put gnome in the parameters "Platforms.set_character(?)". Very sad.
- Also decided to make a level check progress so thatI can finally continue to go West to the jungle biome.
- I forgot the rest of the areas in the jungle :(
